## Me
Hello! I'm starting this blog to document my experiences as I seek to improve my web development skills. My professional background is in enterprise application development, but has almost exclusively involved maintaining and enhancing legacy products using outdated tools and/or frameworks.

## The Project
My initial focus is going to be completing a side project that I started with a couple coworkers last year. It's a simple web app for a local church that lets them track kids' progress in a curriculum that they've set up for their youth group.

## Next Steps
In my next post, I'll create a skeleton for the new app and set up a simple build pipeline.
