summary: A recap of what happened since my last post, and new goals

## Bible Blast
So I had this idea that I would blog about this web project as I built it, but that didn't happen.

The good news is I'm better at shipping code than blog posts, and there is indeed a working instance of my project out there that real humans are really using to administer their youth group curriculum thing (Bible Blast).

The neither-good-nor-bad news is that I'm basically at a stopping point on the project. Nothing is ever truly "done" (which is why Scrum forces you to come up with a definition of done), but they don't have any more pressing needs and I'm ready to move on to something else.

## Goals
I'm going to set up a demo environment of the Bible Blast app so that people can poke around rather than just [look at the code on GitHub](https://github.com/ppalms/bible-blast).

As a short term goal, I want to have that live by next Wednesday, and to write another blog post with a brief walkthrough.

As a long term goal, I want to pick another (smaller) project to build, and actually follow through on blogging about the process. With the holidays coming up, I don't want to be delusional about how much time I'll be able to dedicate to this. I also just realized that 6 weeks from today is January 1st, 2020 which is kind of a fun coincidence. I'm going to shoot for having a small web project published by the new year, with bi-weekly blog posts to go with it.
