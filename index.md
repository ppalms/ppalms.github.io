My name is Patrick and I'm a full-stack developer living in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I've been building enterprise software for about 9 years using Microsoft technologies.

At work, I've mostly used C# with ASP.NET, WinForms, and MS SQL Server. On my side projects, I've enjoyed experimenting with .NET Core and JavaScript libraries like Angular and React.

In my spare time, I enjoy failing at gardening and working on my car.
