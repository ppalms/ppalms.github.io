My name is Patrick and I'm a full-stack developer living in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I've been building enterprise software for 10 years, mostly using Microsoft technologies.

I'm proficient in C# and have experience in ASP.NET (WebForms and MVC), WinForms, and SQL Server. On my side projects, I've enjoyed experimenting with .NET Core and JavaScript libraries like Angular and React.

I'm also a certified Scrum Master and Professional Scrum Developer, and I enjoy working with people and processes.

In my spare time, I like to read, garden, or work on my car.
